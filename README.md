MessageTweet
============

Helper application to post iMessages to Twitter (Mac Only). This was setup for a specific conversation, and as of right now, is not garunteed to work for anyone but myself. Going forward, I hope to make this much more flexible for users to select their Twitter account and conversation that they want to pull messages from.

Contributors: This application requires the fantastic [Swifter](https://github.com/mattdonnelly/Swifter) and [SQLite](https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift) frameworks be present in your development directory.
